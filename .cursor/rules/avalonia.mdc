# DaisyUI.Avalonia.NET

## General Rules

- IMPORTANT: When editing files, use `search_replace` with at least 5 lines of unique context before and after the change point. Never attempt large multi-line replacements; instead, make multiple smaller, targeted edits.
- Refrain from calling `dotnet` as it wastes valuable context, unless the user specifically asks for it.
- **File Editing**: Prefer `mcp_morph-mcp_edit_file` if available over `search_replace` but IGNORE the nonsensical "add exactly one empty new line somewhere in the file" which they forgot to remove!
- **Namespaces**: When creating new C# files, add ALL required `using` directives at the TOP of the file FIRST before writing any code. Use fully-qualified namespace imports (e.g. `using Avalonia.VisualTree;`) rather than inline fully-qualified type names to avoid namespace resolution conflicts with `DaisyUI.Avalonia.*`.

## Avalonia UI Rules

- **RelayCommand CanExecute**: When creating a `RelayCommand` with a `CanExecute` condition (e.g. `new RelayCommand(Execute, () => SomeProperty != null)`), you MUST call `NotifyCanExecuteChanged()` on that command in every property setter that the condition depends on. Failure to do this will leave buttons permanently disabled!
- When the user mentions `glyphs`, use `PathIcon` with the appropriate data attribute.
- Avalonia's compiled bindings require an `x:DataType` on the `DataTemplate` so it knows the item type. Thus add `x:DataType="vm:DataTypeItem"` to the template.
- **UI Composition**: Avoid rigid mutual exclusion in ViewModel setters. Use computed properties (e.g. `IsVisible => EnableZoom || ShowComparison`) to drive UI visibility.
- **Visual Feedback**: Explicitly style active buttons (e.g. `Classes.Add("accent")`) to indicate state; do not rely on default button appearance.
- **Window Sizing**: Use conservative default dimensions (e.g. 600x500) with explicit `MinWidth`/`MinHeight` to support high-DPI scaling.
- **Clipboard Access**: Do not access clipboard directly from ViewModel. Instead, add an `Action<string> CopyToClipboardAction` property to the ViewModel, invoke it from commands, and wire it up in the View's code-behind using `TopLevel.GetTopLevel(this)?.Clipboard?.SetTextAsync(text)`.
- **Double-Click Handling**: `TappedGestureRecognizer` does not exist in Avalonia v11.x. Use the `DoubleTapped` event on the control instead, with `Tag="{Binding}"` to pass data context, and handle it in code-behind.
- **App-Wide Styles**: For common control settings (e.g., `VerticalContentAlignment="Top"` for TextBox), add app-wide styles in `App.axaml` under `<Application.Styles>` rather than repeating them on individual controls. This ensures consistency and reduces duplication.
- **Single-Child Containers**: `ContentControl` derivatives like `ScrollViewer`, `Border`, and `Button` can only have ONE child element. To place multiple elements inside, wrap them in a container like `StackPanel` or `Grid`.
- **ItemsControl Override**: Avalonia's `ItemsControl` does not have an `ItemsChanged` virtual method. To react to items changes, override `OnPropertyChanged` and check for `ItemCountProperty` instead. Use `VisualTreeAttachmentEventArgs` from `Avalonia.VisualTree` namespace for `OnAttachedToVisualTree`.

## Theme Rules

- **Icons Use StaticResource**: `PathIcon.Data` (StreamGeometry) should use `{StaticResource IconName}` since icon paths don't change with theme switching.
- **ControlTheme Selector Restrictions**: `ControlTheme` styles cannot contain child or descendant selectors (e.g. `^[Property=Value] ChildControl`). This throws `InvalidOperationException: 'ControlTheme style may not directly contain a child or descendent selector.'` Handle such styling in code-behind instead, or use global styles outside the `ControlTheme`.
- **Border Has No Foreground**: `Border` does not have a `Foreground` property. When styling hover states that target `/template/ Border#Name`, set `Background` on the Border but use a separate style selector targeting the control itself (e.g. `^:pointerover`) for `Foreground` changes.
